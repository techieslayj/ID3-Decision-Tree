# ID3-Decision-Tree
Standard ML ID3 Decision Tree w/ SKLearn

Dataset is small (60 rows) and has 4 features (Outlook, Temp., Humidity, Wind) and 1 target outcome (to play soccer that day or not to play soccer on that day i.e. Yes or No).  

Comments made throughout code to explain what I am doing at each step. 

*Please feel free to let me know if I have overfit my data when I convert the strings in my dataset to integers or anywhere else in the program. Thank you and enjoy.
